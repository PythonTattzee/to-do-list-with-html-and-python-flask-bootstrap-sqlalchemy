# to-do-list-with-html-and-python-flask-bootstrap-sqlalchemy
ToDo list with python, html, flask, bootstrap, sqlalchemy

In this project I used the SQLite database to store all the todos and Flask framework
to perform actions depending on the user input.
I used Bootstrap for styles, SQLite to store all the records, Flask framework, SqlAlchemy to operate the database actions.
